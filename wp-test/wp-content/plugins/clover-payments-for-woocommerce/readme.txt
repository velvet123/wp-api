The Clover Payments plugin enables merchants that use Woocommerce to process online card payments using Clover.

== Description ==

The Wordpress plugin from Clover allows a merchant using a WordPress based app like Woocommerce
to securely collect card information from buyers and process the payment using their Clover merchant account.
The Payment extension uses an iframe to collect card information. An associated JavaScript tokenizes the card
details by directly communicating with a Clover’s servers. The payment is processed using this token and the
card details are never  saved on WordPress or the merchant’s servers. Therefore, this plug-in does not contribute
to the PCI scope of a merchant’s eCommerce site. The plug-in is free for merchants to use and transactions processed
using this plug-in will be charged under the merchant’s account at Clover.

= Prerequisites =

Clover Merchant or Sandbox account
If you are currently not a Clover merchant or do not have a Clover Sandbox account, you will need to sign up for one at Clover.com
prior to using the Payment extension. You can then use this extension to send transactions to your Sandbox or Production accounts.
We recommend that you test your plugin integration with your Clover sandbox account prior to sending transactions to your production/live
account(s).
